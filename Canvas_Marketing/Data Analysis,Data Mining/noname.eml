What were the data hand-offs involved in the system?
 
This is sort of a weird question.  I have never heard that question before.
Since this is for a data analyst position, this question warrants talking
about your experience with Data Analysis.
 
For <such and such project>, I was responsible for coming up with SLAs
(Service Level Agreement) for our partner.  As a company providing <Such and
such service>, we had to deliver some level of service to our clients.  So,
I worked on coming up with SLAs that had to be met or else we were supposed
to pay a fine to the customer.
 
I was also responsible for fielding lots of requests for reports from
internal users.  These reports were usually presented to these users using
Dash-boards.
 
I also did a lot of data modeling with the help of database programmers.  I
was ACTIVELY involved with ER diagrams.  My job was to make sure that all
business rules are captured in the entities and the relationships between
entities.
 
I used Excel to come up with reports to show patterns between data.  E.g.,
for <such and such project>, I showed that <such and such> increases with
increasing <such and such> [Example: With increasing house-hold income, less
and less people were buying bargain tickets]

Subject: Your interaction with Cross functional teams?

What are cross-functional teams?
A team in a business that incorporates several different departments and
functions. 
 
If asked what was your interaction with cross-functional teams, you can say
that I was involved with various groups in the company.  E.g., with the QA
team, I had to help the QA lead create a test plan.  I gave valuable input
to the QA lead in coming up with a test plan that would cover all the
features of the application that had to be tested.  I helped QA lead decide
what is in scope and what is not in scope.  We also collectively decided the
dates the code will go into QA environment, how often the bugs found in QA
environment will be fixed by the development team and code will be re-built
and installed on the QA servers by the build manager, when will the code go
into UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment, how to coordinate testing with
end users, etc.
 
With the development team, I was the go to person for getting any and all
clarifications on requirements.  Sometimes, the Business Requirements were
not written in the most clear manner.  As such, even the Functional specs
written by some BAs were not very clear.  In this case, when the developers
would have questions on requirements, I was the one liaisoning between
developers and business team to make sure that requirements get clarified.
I was also closely involved with development team to make sure that code was
progressing along at a good pace based on my preliminary project plan.  If a
particular group was slowing down, I had to escalate the issue to the
Project Manager (or myself remove the obstacles that were causing developers
to slow down).
 
With the business team (or end user team), I was primarily responsible for
conducting status meetings to keep the business team updated with the
project status, handle scope changes, conduct user trainings, etc.
 
Hope you get the idea about cross-functional teams.
 
Thanks,
