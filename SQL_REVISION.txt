SQL concepts - 


BASIC SQL SYNTAX

SELECT, - - THE COLUMNS MENTIONED IN THE SELECT SEGMENT ARE OUTPUT AS THE RESULT OF QUERY
FROM,
JOIN, - - IF INFORMATION IS EXTENDED ACROSS TABLES AND THE TABLES ARE LINKED BY CERTAIN COMMON COLUMNS THEN WE CAN JOIN THE TABLES TO GET REQUIRED DATA
WHERE, - - APPLY FILTER TO THE RESULTSET
GROUP BY, - - GROUP THE DATA USING SOME COLUMNS. COLUMNS IN GROUP BY AND SELECT MUST BE SAME(EXCEPT ANALYTICAL/AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS)
HAVING, - - APPLY FILTER AFTER AGGREGATING THE DATA
ORDER BY - - SORT THE DATA IN ANY ORDER USING ANY SELECTION OF COLUMNS(COLUMNS DONT HAVE TO BE IN THE SELECT CLAUSE)

JOINS

INNER JOIN, - - A INNER JOIN B ON A.X = B.X/Y(COLUMN NAMES DO NOT HAVE TO EXACTLY MATCH, HOWEVER MEANING OF THE COLUMNS HAVE TO HAVE A RELATION) - RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM BOTH TABLES AS LONG AS THERE IS A MATCH BETWEEN THE COLUMNS BASED ON THE JOIN.

LEFT OUTER JOIN/LEFT JOIN, - - A LEFT OUTER JOIN B - RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE AND THE MATCHING ROWS IN THE RIGHT TABLE BASED ON JOIN CONDITION AND THE RESULT IS NULL IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN THERE IS NO MATCH.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN/RIGHT JOIN, - - A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B - RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE AND THE MATCHING ROWS IN THE LEFT TABLE BASED ON JOIN CONDITION AND THE RESULT IS NULL IN THE LEFT SIDE WHEN THERE IS NO MATCH.

FULL OUTER JOIN/FULL JOIN, - - A FULL OUTER JOIN B - RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE AND ALL THE ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE BASED ON JOIN CONDITION. COMBINES THE RESULT OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT JOINS.

CROSS JOIN, - - A CROSS JOIN B - RETURNS CARTESIAN PRODUCT OF TWO TABLES.

SELF JOIN - - JOINING A TABLE WITH IT SELF.
